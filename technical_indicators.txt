ichmoku cloud:

if last 5 periods ltp > Leading Span A and Leading Span A  > Leading Span B (green) and 1.01*leadingspan A > ltp > Leading Span A then trigger alert buy

if last 5 periods ltp < Leading Span A and  Leading Span B > Leading Span A (red) and 1.01*leadingspan A < ltp < Leading Span A then trigger alert sell

if conversion line(9 periods) above base line (9 periods) and next conversion line(5 periods) below base line (5 periods) and cloud should be red then trigger buy

if conversion line(9 periods) below base line (9 periods) and next conversion line(5 periods) above base line (5 periods) and cloud should be green then 
trigger sell

parabolic

RPSAR = Rising PSAR
AF = Acceleration Factor, it starts at 0.02 and
increases by 0.02, up to a maximum of 0.2, each
time the extreme point makes a new low (falling
SAR) or high(rising SAR)
FPSAR = Falling PSAR
EP = Extreme Point, the lowest low in the current
downtrend(falling SAR)or the highest high in the
current uptrend(rising SAR)
​
RPSAR=Prior PSAR +
[Prior AF(Prior EP-Prior PSAR)]
FPSAR=Prior PSAR −
[Prior AF(Prior PSAR-Prior EP)]


MACD

Fibonacci



changes:

check whether a stock is in uptrend or not check the chronological order

in uptrend, all time low=1 , all time high=0
down trend, all time low=0 , all time high=1

MACD:

macd (12 period) crosses above signal(9 period) and check in the last 2 periods 

RPSAR:
cross over and should be consistent over 3 periods



------------------------------changes to be done--------------------------

SAR Signal:

Check the last two candles and if there is a change in the signal then trigger alerts with latest signal

MACD Signal:

Check the last two candles and if there is a change in the signal then check last 5 periods other than the 2 periods if it is consistent with the 2nd period signal then trigger the latest signal
